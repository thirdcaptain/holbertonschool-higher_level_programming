### 0-javascript_is_amazing.js
A script that prints “Javascript is amazing”

### 1-multi_languages.js
A script that prints 3 lines:  

The first line: “C is fun”  
The second line: “Python is cool”  
The third line: “Javascript is amazing”  

### 2-arguments.js
A script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:  

If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”  
If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”  
Otherwise, print “Arguments found”  

### 3-value_argument.js
A script that prints the first argument passed to it:

If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”

### 4-concat.js
A script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

### 5-to_integer.js
A script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer:

If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”

### 6-multi_languages_loop.js
A script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop

The first line: “C is fun”  
The second line: “Python is cool”  
The third line: “Javascript is amazing”  

### 7-multi_c.js
A script that prints x times “C is fun”

Where x is the first argument of the script  
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”  

### 8-square.js
A script that prints a square

The first argument is the size of the square

### 9-add.js
A script that prints the addition of 2 integers

The first argument is the first integer  
The second argument is the second integer  
You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)

### 10-factorial.js
a recursive script that computes and prints a factorial using a function  
The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial

### 11-second_biggest.js
A script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.

### 12-object.js
