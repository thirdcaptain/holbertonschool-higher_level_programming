# 0x13. Javascript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

20180904 - The purpose of this project is to introduce Javascript object oriented programming concepts

### 0-rectangle.js
An empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle

### 1-rectangle.js
Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h  
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w  
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h  

### 2-rectangle.js
Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h  
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w  
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h  
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object  

### 3-rectangle.js
Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h  
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w  
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h  
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object  
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X

### 4-rectangle.js
Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h  
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w  
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h  
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object  
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X  
Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle  
Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2  


### 5-square.js
Class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:  
The constructor must take 1 argument: size  

### 6-square.js
Class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:  
The constructor must take 1 argument: size  
Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c

### 7-occurrences.js
Function that returns the number of occurrences in a list

### 8-esrever.js
Function that returns the reversed version of a list

### 9-logme.js
Function that prints the number of argument already printed and the new argument value

### 10-converter.js
Function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument
